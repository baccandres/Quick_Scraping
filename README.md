# Quick_Scraping

The quick scraping project is about delivering a brief report on a free topic in a 6 hours timeframe.

For this matter I chose to scrape the Lega Serie A (italian soccer league) standings from 2003 to 2020, using Selenium. Then I cleaned and structured the data to represent it in a few visuals.

Please open the 'md' file 'Serie A Report' to follow the conclusions.

Programming language: Python.

Libraries used:
-requests
-selenium
-time
-webdriver_manager
-pandas
-numpy
-re
-seaborn
-matplotlib
